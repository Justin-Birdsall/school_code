Hi this is my school coding github repository. Each Folder has the classes that I took for that year at GVSU. Most of it will be out of date or missing. I am starting this at theend of my Junior year. I will still try to populate it and condense some of my older repositories so there is less navigating around my page to find that one file instead it will all be in place
