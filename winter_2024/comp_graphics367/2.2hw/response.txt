Hi Professor,

I want to first apologize for missing class on Thursday and not submitting the homework
on time. As of now all of my work should be in the correct drop box and also on my github pages.
Thank you for reaching out to me, I actually have been meaning to send you a message for a second.
On the surface it may appear that I don't care about the assignments, but I actually enjoy learning
and trying to implement what has been assigned to us. I think that if I give you more of a background
on who I am as a person and where I am coming from in terms of schooling.

This is my fourth semester here at GVSU with one qrstuvwxyz 
At my core, I have a satirical and ironic outlook on life, yet I am a very serious person. I hope that by sharing
this aspect of my personality, you'll be okay with me dropping some of the formality in this email. To say the least
the reason that I haven't turned in any assignments is because I got the brain bugs, in other words I am neurodivergent.
Last year I was diagnosed with ADHD with the primaily innatentive typing, which has helped me understand myself more.
Yet 



So I hope that  
	--Something that I am passionate about is education
