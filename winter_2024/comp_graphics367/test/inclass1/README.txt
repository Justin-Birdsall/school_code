     Hi Professor, 
     
        I want to take a minute introduce myself. This is my 2nd winter semester here at gvsu
        and I am very excited for all my cis courses this semester. Although, I am  interested
        in this course and computer graphics in geneal. What makes it so appealing is
        that it allows me to be creative. Something about me that I was diagnosed with ADHD a year
        ago. I am currently working on getting the completed form to gvsu. While, I haven't seen what 
        accommodations that I was recommended. Knowing myself though, I don't like having late
        assignments but sometimes the only time I can focus at home is when everyone goes to sleep at my 
        house hold, so sometimes I always try to finish up the assignments an hour or two past the due date.
        I am really trying to stay up on my work though this semester I've gone through some med adjustments 
        recently which leads me to my next point. I wanted to apologize for missing class on Thursday of the 11th.
        With the semester starting I met up with my doctor on wednesday for a medcheck and while I was there got both a flu and
        covid-19 shot. Thursday morning I managed to stick around for my morning class but was feeling awful and 
        went home to lay down before heading back to campus and my body told me to rest and ended up sleeping through class.
        Hopefully though I should be a little more protected in class so I hopefully don't miss another due to illness.
        I have also linked a couple of videos from a recent star citizen tech demo for future graphics they are implementing.
        The other is hair that they just added into game. I think it's very remarkable the graphics they are starting to 
        obtain at such a scale.
